Shopping List API's Example


- You could create different shopping lists;
- You could add, remove, modify one or more shopping items to/from every list;
- Every item should refer to a specific product with its name and price;
- You can select the same product more than once (quantity>1);
- The standard shipping cost is 10 credits;
- If you collect items for more than or equal to 100 credits in your shopping list then the shipping is free of charge;
- Your public API's for the first release should allow the client to create a new shopping list, add item/s to a shopping list and to get the total price.
